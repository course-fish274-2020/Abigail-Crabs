Concept ----
  What are Ghost crabs?
  Where do they live?


Goals ----
   Present code in way that is understandable
   Find out if burrow shape and/or depth affect burrow humidity and/or temp


Required packages



1. Import data ----
    Where is data from? (year 2016)
    Insert link
    Head data (change width)



2. Filter data ----
    Minimizes extra variables
      1 Site
      1 month
      Shape, depth, temperature, humidity



3. How does shape affect humidity and temp of burrow? ----
    Select shape and temp
      (a). Shape vs. temperature
          Table
          Graph
      (b). Shape vs. humidity
          Table
          Graph
      (c). Is there an effect?


4. How does depth affect humidity and temp of burrow? ----
    Select depth and humidity
      (a). Depth vs. temp
          Table
          Graph
      (b). Depth vs. Humidity
          Table
          Graph
      (c). Is there an effect?


Conclusion ----
  Re-show graphs
  Restate if correlation apparent
  Thank you slide
