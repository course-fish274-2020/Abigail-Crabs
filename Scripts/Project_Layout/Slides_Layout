Title: Human Impact on Ghost Crab Burrow Altercation


----- Concept -----
- Ghost crab population size declines under high human impact
  - Respond strongly to impacts so good indicator of effective beach management
- Human impact on burrow dimensions is still being debated
  - Data collected from 20 beaches in South Carolina, USA to determine this impact


----- Goals -----
1. Load data from [Ghost Crab Burrow Morphology and Distribution](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6895109)
2. Determine human impact on ghost crab burrow morphology
3. Present findings in way that is understandable



---- Required packages -----
- Tidyverse
- Magrittr
- Knitr


---- Importing Data -----
Ghost Crab Burrow Morphology and Distribution was collected between May and Septemeber of 2016



---- Filtering Data -----
Opening diameter (mm) vs. Impact types
Density (m^2) vs. Impact types
Length (mm) vs. Impact types


---- Plotting Data -----
Opening diameter (mm) vs. Impact types (done)
Density (m^2) vs. Impact types
Length (mm) vs. Impact types



---- Conclusion -----
  This analysis determines that there is a high correlation between human impact and altercation of ghost crab burrows.
  An increase in human disturbance leads to deeper and smaller burrows.
