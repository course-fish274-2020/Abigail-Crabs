# Concept ----
  # What are Ghost crabs?
  # Where do they live?
  # Where is data from?


# Goals ----
  # Present code in way that is understandable
  # Find out if burrow shape and/or depth affect burrow humidity and/or temp


# Required packages



# 1. Import data ----
  # Where is data from? (year 2016)
  # Insert link
  # Head data (change width)



# 2. Filter data ----
  # Minimizes extra variables
      # 1 Site
      # 1 month
      # Shape, depth, temperature, humidity



# 3. How does shape affect humidity and temp of burrow? ----
  #Select shape and temp
    # (a). Shape vs. temperature
        # Table
        # Graph
    # (b). Shape vs. humidity
        #Table
        #Graph
    # (c). Is there an effect?


# 4. How does depth affect humidity and temp of burrow? ----
  #Select depth and humidity
    # (a). Depth vs. temp
        # Table
        # Graph
    # (b). Depth vs. Humidity
        # Table
        # Graph
    # (c). Is there an effect?


# Conclusion ----
  # Re-show graphs
  # Restate if correlation apparent
  # Thank you slide
